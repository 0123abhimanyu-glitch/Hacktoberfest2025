# 🚀 Merge All PRs - Step by Step Guide

This guide will help you merge all open pull requests efficiently without conflicts.

## 🎯 The Problem
- Multiple PRs are editing the same file (`contributors/contributorsList.js`)
- Each PR adds a contributor at the end of the array
- When you merge one PR, all others get conflicts

## 🛠 Solution: Merge All At Once

### Option 1: Use the Automated Script (Recommended)

1. **Collect all new contributors from open PRs:**
   - Go through each open PR
   - Copy the contributor object from each PR (the part that looks like this):
   ```javascript
   {
     id: XXX,
     fullname: "Name",
     username: "https://github.com/username",
   }
   ```

2. **Edit `merge_prs_script.js`:**
   - Open the `merge_prs_script.js` file I created
   - Add all new contributors to the `newContributors` array in this format:
   ```javascript
   const newContributors = [
     { fullname: "John Doe", username: "https://github.com/johndoe" },
     { fullname: "Jane Smith", username: "https://github.com/janesmith" },
     // Add all contributors from PRs here...
   ];
   ```

3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   node merge_prs_script.js
   ```

4. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add contributors/contributorsList.js
   git commit -m "Merge all Hacktoberfest contributors"
   git push origin master
   ```

5. **Close all PRs:**
   - Go to each PR and close it with a comment like:
   "Thank you for your contribution! Your changes have been merged manually to resolve conflicts. 🎉"

### Option 2: Manual Method

If you prefer to do it manually:

1. **Create a backup:**
   ```bash
   cp contributors/contributorsList.js contributors/contributorsList.js.backup
   ```

2. **For each open PR:**
   - Copy the new contributor object
   - Add it to your local `contributorsList.js` file
   - Assign a unique ID (start from 442, since 441 is the current highest)

3. **Remove duplicates** (if any)

4. **Commit and push** the updated file

5. **Close all PRs** with a thank you message

## 📝 Template for PR Comments

When closing PRs, you can use this template:

```
🎉 Thank you for your contribution to Hacktoberfest2024!

Your changes have been merged manually into the main branch to resolve merge conflicts that occur when multiple contributors edit the same file.

Your contribution is now live in the contributors list! 🚀

Thank you for being part of open source! #Hacktoberfest
```

## 🔧 Fixing ID Sequencing (Optional)

If you want to clean up the ID numbers to be sequential:

1. Edit `merge_prs_script.js`
2. Uncomment this line: `// fixIdSequencing();`
3. Run the script again: `node merge_prs_script.js`

## 🚨 Emergency Rollback

If something goes wrong:
```bash
git checkout contributors/contributorsList.js
# Or restore from backup:
cp contributors/contributorsList.js.backup contributors/contributorsList.js
```

## 📊 Current Status

Current highest ID in the list: **441**
Next available ID: **442**
